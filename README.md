# Two Ropes Puzzle â€“ Visualization

An interactive visualization of the classic "two ropes" time-measurement puzzle.

## Puzzle (short)

You have a lighter and two ropes. Each rope takes exactly 60 minutes to burn from one end to the other, but the ropes burn unevenly along their lengths (so you cannot assume any linear relation like "half the rope = 30 minutes"). The challenge: measure exactly 45 minutes.

This project simulates two unevenly burning ropes, shows the elapsed time and burn progress.
